group_installed_capacity-capex-MP.png,Existing & New Capacity,"The plot shows the projected energy capacity mix over the planning horizon across different scenarios. The y-axis represents energy capacity in gigawatts (GW), including both existing and new capacity. Each bar is segmented by energy sources, such as solar, wind, gas, coal, nuclear, hydro, and other sources, with existing capacity shown in a cross-hatched pattern."
group_electricity_generation-capex-MP.png,Energy Generation Mix: Annual,"The plot shows the projected electricity generation mix over the planning horizon across different scenarios. The y-axis represents electricity generation in terawatt-hours (TWh). Each bar is segmented by various energy sources, including coal, gas, solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear, along with elements like battery storage, pumped storage, imports, exports, and shedding. The plot highlights shifts in generation sources over time."
energy_dispatch-capex-MP.png,Energy Generation Mix: Sample Days,"The figure contains three plots, each representing the energy generation mix over a 24-hour period on  different dates. The x-axis shows hourly time intervals over all hours of the day, while the y-axis represents energy in gigawatt-hours (GWh). The plots show a variation in the share and types of energy sources used throughout the day, with shifts in the mix over time."
GHG_emissions-capex-MP.png,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The plot shows projected greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, measured in million metric tons of CO2(MtCO2), over the planning horizon under various scenarios. The y-axis represents the level of GHG emissions, while the x-axis shows the years. The plot illustrates the potential impact of different energy strategies on emissions reduction over time."
GHG_emissions_intensity-capex-MP.png,Greenhouse Gas Intensity,"The plot displays projected greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity, measured in metric tons of CO2 per megawatt-hour (MtCO2/MWh), over the planning horizon under various scenarios. The y-axis shows GHG intensity, while the x-axis marks the years. The plot illustrates the anticipated changes in emissions intensity per unit of energy generated, reflecting changes in the carbon efficiency of the energy mix over time."
system_cost-capex-MP.png,Electricity Costs,"This plot shows projected electricity costs in USD per megawatt-hour (USD/MWh) over the planning horizon various scenarios. The y-axis represents costs, while the x-axis marks the years. The plot suggests potential cost fluctuations in electricity generation."
